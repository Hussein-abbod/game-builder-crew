design_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the user's rough game idea:
    
    "{game}"
    
    Expand this into a detailed Technical Game Design Document to be handed off to a Senior Engineer.
    
    1. Define the objective and rules.
    2. List necessary classes (Player, Enemy, etc.).
    3. Define controls (e.g., Arrow keys, Space bar).
    4. Specify Pygame as the library.
    5. Ensure the scope is manageable for a single script.
    
    Your output MUST be clear and structured so the Engineer can implement it without questions.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed technical specification for the Senior Engineer to follow.

code_task:
  description: >
    You are the Senior Software Engineer.
    
    Instructions
    ------------
    1. READ the Technical Design Document provided by the Senior Game Designer (from the previous task).
    2. Write the COMPLETE Python code based EXACTLY on those specifications.
    3. Do not add features not in the design.
    4. Do not miss features in the design.
  expected_output: >
    Your Final answer must be the full python code, only the python code and nothing else.

review_task:
  description: >
    You are the QA Engineer.
    
    Instructions
    ------------
    1. Review the Code provided by the Senior Engineer.
    2. Compare it strictly against the Technical Design Document provided by the Game Designer.
    3. **CRITICAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST** (You MUST check ALL of these):
       a) **Syntax Validation**: Read through EVERY line and verify Python syntax is correct
       b) **Variable Definitions**: Verify EVERY variable/constant used is actually defined
       c) **Typos**: Check for typos in variable names (e.g., SPEED_INCREASE_INCREASE_AMOUNT vs SPEED_INCREASE_AMOUNT)
       d) **Imports**: Verify all necessary imports are present at the top
       e) **Logic Errors**: Check that the logic matches the design document
       f) **Missing Features**: Ensure no design requirements are missing
       g) **Indentation**: Verify proper Python indentation throughout
    4. **BEFORE returning the code**, mentally trace through the execution to catch runtime errors.
    5. If you find ANY errors, fix them yourself and return the corrected version.
    6. DO NOT approve code with undefined variables, typos, or syntax errors.
  expected_output: >
    Your Final answer must be the full python code, only the python code and nothing else.

  description: >
    You are the Chief QA Engineer.
    
    Instructions
    ------------
    1. Review the final code from the QA Engineer.
    2. Ensure it still meets the original User Vision and Design Document.
    3. **FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST** (Your last chance to catch bugs):
       a) **Run a Mental Execution**: Think like a Python interpreter - trace through the code line by line
       b) **Constant Verification**: Check that EVERY constant referenced (e.g., SCREEN_WIDTH, SPEED_INCREASE_AMOUNT) is defined
       c) **Variable Name Consistency**: Look for typos like doubled words (e.g., INCREASE_INCREASE instead of INCREASE)
       d) **Import Completeness**: Verify all modules used are imported
       e) **Syntax Final Check**: One last scan for syntax errors, missing colons, mismatched parentheses
       f) **Deployment Readiness**: Confirm the code can run without crashing immediately
    4. If you find ANY bugs (even small typos), fix them before returning.
    5. Think like a compiler - catch errors BEFORE the user runs the code.
